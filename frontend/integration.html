                <p>Haggle is a platform that allows users to compare prices of products from different e-commerce merchants. 
                    Haggle is accessible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users, but with the authenticated users having full access to the platform.</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="userflow1">Haggle goes to various merchants/ e-commerce stores and gets aggregated product based on customer reviews and ratings and price, and displays them to you.
                    When you use the search box to search for a product, or select a product through the category section, your request/function will be sent to the database,
                    which then releases the data of the product you searched, or the category you selected, to you. The data from the various available merchants have been scraped
                    using specific scraping tools. See SDKs and Plugins for more info on the scraping tools.</p>
