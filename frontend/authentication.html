                <p>Haggle allows both the authenticated and unauthenticated user access to the platform with the authenticated user having 
                    full access to the platform.
                    A user is required to be authenticated before granted full access to the platform.  </p>

                <hr>
                <p class="userflow1">When an unauthenticated user visits the landing page, the user would be able to view and interact basically with the page.
                    The user would be able to browse through available products by using the search filter function or by using the category section for easy navigation through products.
                    When the unauthenticated user selects a product, the user will then be directed to the product page that’ll contain the specific product from different merchants with their prices.
                    The unauthenticated user will only be able to view and compare prices from 2 different merchants. 
                    On request to “view more prices", the unauthenticated user will get redirected to the login page.</p>

                <p class="userflow2">After a user becomes authenticated, the user gets full access to the platform. The user will be able to browse through available
                    products and get price comparisons from all available platforms. After authentication, several options like comment boxes and the share options that 
                    are not available to the unauthenticated user will become available. 
                    The authenticated user will be able to comment directly under products and prices.
                    Also available on the product page of the authenticated user will be the link to the purchase page of the product from the selected platform. 
                    The user will be redirected to the e-commerce platform for product purchase once the link is clicked.</p>
